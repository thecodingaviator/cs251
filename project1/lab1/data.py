class Data:
    def __init__(self, filepath=None, headers=None, data=None, header2col=None):
        '''Data object constructor

        Parameters:
        -----------
        filepath: str or None. Path to data .csv file
        headers: Python list of strings or None. List of strings that explain the name of each
            column of data.
        data: ndarray or None. shape=(N, M).
            N is the number of data samples (rows) in the dataset and M is the number of variables
            (cols) in the dataset.
            2D numpy array of the datasetâ€™s values, all formatted as floats.
            NOTE: In Week 1, don't worry working with ndarrays yet. Assume it will be passed in
                  as None for now.
        header2col: Python dictionary or None.
                Maps header (var str name) to column index (int).
                Example: "sepal_length" -> 0

        TODO:
        - Declare/initialize the following instance variables:
            - filepath
            - headers
            - data
            - header2col
            - Any others you find helpful in your implementation
        - If `filepath` isn't None, call the `read` method.

    def read(self, filepath):
        '''Read in the .csv file `filepath` in 2D tabular format. Convert to numpy ndarray called
        `self.data` at the end (think of this as 2D array or table).

        Format of `self.data`:
            Rows should correspond to i-th data sample.
            Cols should correspond to j-th variable / feature.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        filepath: str or None. Path to data .csv file

        Returns:
        -----------
        None. (No return value).
            NOTE: In the future, the Returns section will be omitted from docstrings if
            there should be nothing returned

        TODO:
        - Read in the .csv file `filepath` to set `self.data`. Parse the file to only store
        numeric columns of data in a 2D tabular format (ignore non-numeric ones). Make sure
        everything that you add is a float.
        - Represent `self.data` (after parsing your CSV file) as an numpy ndarray. To do this:
            - At the top of this file write: import numpy as np
            - Add this code before this method ends: self.data = np.array(self.data)
        - Be sure to fill in the fields: `self.headers`, `self.data`, `self.header2col`.

        NOTE: You may wish to leverage Python's built-in csv module. Check out the documentation here:
        https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html

        NOTE: In any CS251 project, you are welcome to create as many helper methods as you'd like.
        The crucial thing is to make sure that the provided method signatures work as advertised.

        NOTE: You should only use the basic Python library to do your parsing.
        (i.e. no Numpy or imports other than csv).
        Points will be taken off otherwise.

        TIPS:
        - If you're unsure of the data format, open up one of the provided CSV files in a text editor
        or check the project website for some guidelines.
        - Check out the test scripts for the desired outputs.

        (Week 2)

        For example, if self.headers = ['a', 'b', 'c'] and we pass in header = 'b', we return
        column #2 of self.data. If rows is not [] (say =[0, 2, 5]), then we do the same thing,
        but only return rows 0, 2, and 5 of column #2.

        Parameters:
        -----------
            headers: Python list of str. Header names to take from self.data
            rows: Python list of int. Indices of subset of data samples to select.
                Empty list [] means take all rows

        Returns:
        -----------
        ndarray. shape=(num_data_samps, len(headers)) if rows=[]
                 shape=(len(rows), len(headers)) otherwise
            Subset of data from the variables `headers` that have row indices `rows`.
