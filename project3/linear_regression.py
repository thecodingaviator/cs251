        '''Performs a linear regression on the independent (predictor) variable(s) `ind_vars`
        and dependent variable `dep_var.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        ind_vars: Python list of strings. 1+ independent variables (predictors) entered in the regression.
            Variable names must match those used in the `self.data` object.
        dep_var: str. 1 dependent variable entered into the regression.
            Variable name must match one of those used in the `self.data` object.

        TODO:
        - Use your data object to select the variable columns associated with the independent and
        dependent variable strings.
        - Perform linear regression by using Scipy to solve the least squares problem y = Ac
        for the vector c of regression fit coefficients. Don't forget to add the coefficient column
        for the intercept!
        - Compute R^2 on the fit and the residuals.
        - By the end of this method, all instance variables should be set (see constructor).

        NOTE: Use other methods in this class where ever possible (do not write the same code twice!)

        Parameters:
        -----------
        X: ndarray. shape=(num_data_samps, num_ind_vars).
            If None, use self.A for the "x values" when making predictions.

        dep_var: string. Dependent variable name
        title: string. Title for the plot

        TODO:
        - Use your scatter() in Analysis to handle the plotting of points. Note that it returns
        the (x, y) coordinates of the points.
        - Sample evenly spaced x values for the regression line between the min and max x data values
        - Use your regression slope, intercept, and x sample points to solve for the y values on the
        regression line.
        - Plot the line on top of the scatterplot.

        -----------
        data_vars: Python list of strings. Variable names in self.data to include in the pair plot.
        fig_sz: tuple. len(fig_sz)=2. Width and height of the whole pair plot figure.
            This is useful to change if your pair plot looks enormous or tiny in your notebook!
        hists_on_diag: bool. If true, draw a histogram of the variable along main diagonal of
            pairplot.

        TODO:
        - Use your pair_plot() in Analysis to take care of making the grid of scatter plots.
        Note that this method returns the figure and axes array that you will need to superimpose
        the regression lines on each subplot panel.
        - In each subpanel, plot a regression line of the ind and dep variable. Follow the approach
        that you used for self.scatter. Note that here you will need to fit a new regression for
        every ind and dep variable pair.
        - Make sure that each plot has a title (with R^2 value in it)

        A: ndarray. shape=(num_data_samps, 1)

            x^1, x^2, ..., x^9, x^10.

        NOTE: There should not be a intercept term ("x^0"), the linear regression solver method

        -----------
        ind_var: str. Independent variable entered in the single regression.
            Variable names must match those used in the `self.data` object.

             x^1, x^2, ..., x^9, x^10, and a column of homogeneous coordinates (1s).

        TODO:
        - This method should mirror the structure of self.linear_regression (compute all the same things)
        - Differences are:
            - You create a matrix based on the independent variable data matrix (self.A) with columns
            appropriate for polynomial regresssion. Do this with self.make_polynomial_matrix.
            - You set the instance variable for the polynomial regression degree (self.p)
